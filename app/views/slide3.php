		2000-2005:  Web as Print
	</h3>
	<p>
	In the net phase of web design, the web was viewed as a surrogate for print design.  Layouts were designed in 
	tables, which were then inline-styled using html tags.  Web pages tended to load slowly, and were often 
	just photoshop files cut up so little pieces of text or other elements could be reused.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Macromedia offered a suite of products that incorporated into this workflow with DreamWeaver, Flash, and 
		Fireworks creating a full workflow for creating webpages.
