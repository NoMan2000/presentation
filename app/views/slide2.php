		1999:  Frames
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the earliest (and darkest) days of web design we used frames to style our webpages.  They were 
		often problematic, but due to problems with the DOM, the lack of WYSIWYG tools at the time, and 
		sophisticated backend frameworks, they were the first attempt to style the web page with more content
		than simple pages allowed.
